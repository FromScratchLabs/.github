## 🧠 Philosophy

> **"You don't truly understand something until you can build it from scratch."**

In an age of abstraction and complex frameworks, we go back to first principles. We believe the best way to master any concept is to strip away the magic and reconstruct it with your own hands.

**Our Core Principles:**
* 🔍 **Deep Understanding** over superficial knowledge
* 🛠️ **Learning by Building** through hands-on implementation  
* 📚 **Clear Documentation** that educates and inspires
* 🤝 **Open Collaboration** across all skill levels
* 💡 **Simple, Readable Code** that reveals the underlying concepts

### 👨‍💻 How to Contribute
We welcome contributors of all levels! Here's how you can help:

1. **Pick a Project** - Browse our labs and find something that interests you
2. **Read the Guide** - Each project has detailed `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines
3. **Choose Your Approach**:
   - 🎯 **Implement** a concept in a new programming language
   - 📖 **Improve** documentation and add explanations
   - 🧪 **Add** tests and benchmarks
   - 🔍 **Fix** bugs and optimize existing implementations

### 🏗️ Project Structure
Each project follows this consistent structure:

```
project-name/
├── THEORY.md # Conceptual explanation and theory
├── implementations/ # Code in various languages
│   ├── python/
│   ├── javascript/
│   └── rust/
├── examples/ # Practical usage examples
├── benchmarks/ # Performance tests and comparisons
└── CONTRIBUTING.md # Project-specific guidelines
```

## 📚 Learning Paths

**For Beginners:**
1. Start with `data-structures/` - Build linked lists, arrays, and hash maps
2. Move to `algorithms/` - Implement sorting and searching algorithms
3. Explore `simple-db/` - Understand how databases work internally

**For Intermediate Developers:**
1. Tackle `web-server/` - Create HTTP servers from scratch
2. Experiment with `compiler/` - Build a simple programming language
3. Dive into `operating-system/` - Understand OS fundamentals
